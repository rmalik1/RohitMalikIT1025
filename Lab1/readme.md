#### Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab1 is to explore the different components and eras of computing history and sheds light on several interesting developments. One notable progress was the development of client server architecture in the min-1980s that led to the development of the Enterprise Resource Planning systems. Additionally, this Lab prepares provides functional knowledge for GitHub.
#### Information System Components: The five components of an information system are:
+ Hardware: Tangible, physical portion of an information system like computers, disk drives, etc.
+ Software: Sets of instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Examples include Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS, etc.
+	Data: Address of a person, phone number of a person
+	People: Developers, CIO, etc.
+ rocess: SQL
#### GitHub: It is an industry tool that serve as a hosting platform for software development
Cient- Server Architecture: Computer network in which several computers request and receive service from a centralized database/computer. GitHub is an example of Client-Server architecture as under this platform several users request information from a centralized server to develop software.
Cloud Computing: Cloud computing provides users with mobile access to data and applications. Examples include Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft 365
#### Conclusion
Through the course of this lab I learned about GitHub and several developments in the field of Information Systems. I had to face a lot of difficulty with adding a file to the repository. I revisited the process multiple times and was finally successful. I look forward to spending more time on GitHub and get more familiar with creating a new pull request and forking a repository
